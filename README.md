I wrote a bash script to convert these nice icons from svg to png files, to be used in the [xfce4-weather-plugin](http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-weather-plugin).

### Usage Instructions
* Run the make-xfce-weather.sh script from the console
* Select the desired theme
* Copy the 3 generated folders and the theme.info file
* Right click on the xfce weather plugin on the taskbar and select Properties
* Click on the icon near Icon theme: the icons folder will open.
* Create a new folder and name it Underground. Paste the folders and the theme file inside this new folder.
* Close and re-open the xfce weather plugin Properties window. In the Icon theme dropdown list the Underground theme will be present.

Have fun!
